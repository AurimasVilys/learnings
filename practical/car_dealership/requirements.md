### Task
1. Create models to satisfy client needs
2. Create a diagram to show application logic when creating vehicles
3. Application will only be later improved with more logic about the vehicles.
4. Mark down any "question" made to client and what was the assumption.

### Assumptions
1. Create currently only a sistem that supports configuring only configuring and creating cars
2. Currently don't reflect about additional equiment logic (for example improved fire safery can be selected for all types of trucks)
3. All created vehicles should be stored in a file
4. If there is any question to the client (from a business side) make an assumption and implement by assumption.
